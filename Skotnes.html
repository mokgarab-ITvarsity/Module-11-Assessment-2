            <h2>Welcome to Skotnes Restaurant & Bar</h2>
            <p>- I took the plunge. As you walk into this venue you are greeted by the charming manager & his staff.
                They make you feel so welcome, thank you.</p>
            <p>- The Skotnes restaurant at the Norval Foundation with Phil de Villiers the resident chef whom I was
                introduced to, Kyle our waitron and Shaun the manager - made for a superb and relaxing environment to be
                in.The service was outstanding - right down to them bringing a Tabard candle to the table when a fly
                appeared from nowhere, without any prompting from me. A risotto is often a risky menu item - and I
                ordered the sweetcorn one - I was a little nervous but it restored my faith in good chefs - it was
                outstanding. My husband had the pea and Natal porcini gnocchi and didn't complain - gathered it was very
                good too. The large garden filled with sculptures and showcasing/representing South Africa and Africa's
                finest talent should not be missed. Everything at the Normal Foundation is world class - from their
                incredibly tempting in-house shop to the galleries exhibiting their art - from the quirky to the
                technically brilliant. Its Zeitz MOCAA on a much smaller scale and boasting an enviable garden, coupled
                with a far superior restaurant and shop, along with un-challenging parking.</p>
            <p>-We went for lunch to celebrate my wifeâ€™s birthday. We both had a 2 course meal as part of their Winter
                special. Really enjoyed the food which was excellent and well presented. As an added touch, the
                restaurant provides a small rest for all Ladies handbags so that they do not have to be placed on the
                floor.</p>
