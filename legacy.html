            <h2>Welcome to Legacy Yard</h2>
            <p>- A lovely weekend chill spot accompanied by some great treats ... love the set up kudos team Legacy Yard
                hoping to see many more attractions added on</p>
            <p>- Great new bar scene in Umhlanga. The set up is a few restaurants and tables to eat at. Of coarse the
                there is a bar.
                We went for a drink and decided to try the Home base pizzeria.
                They do a medium and large with a few choices for toppings the large is a bit small if you are hungry.
                They have their base perfect in the way it tastes but very thin not a typical genuine pizza base, a bit
                of charing on the edges they got ours right however some of the .the pizzas coming out of the oven
                before ours were very chard. The toppings were reasonable and tasty.
                Maybe we went the first week or so of opening and they haven't built enough experience with their oven
                so we will go back in a week or so and give it another try.</p>
