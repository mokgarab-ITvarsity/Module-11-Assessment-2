            <h2>Welcome to Hobs Restaurant & Bar</h2>
            <p>- Awesome little bar right next to the beach. Cocktails are great, food is amazing and the staff are
                friendly and attentive even at their busiest</p>
            <p>- Great value for money food with incredible location! A must visit while in Durban - worth the drive. My
                daughter is vegetarian and she had some good options and we all loved our food!</p>
            <p>- Was happy to see the renovations done at Hops. Gr8 vibe, gr8 service. Food is tasty. New menu with Gin
                cocktails and beer on tap a good improvement. Beautiful view of the ocean, whilst dining. Highly
                recommended.</p>
            <p>- We had lunch and it was delicious.
                I had the lamb curry and is was amazing I really enjoyed it, the only thing that put me off was the hair
                I found in my food after I had finished right at the bottom of the bowl.
                The others hard cheesy garlic snails and it was really cheesy like it should be and we had nachos. The
                nachos was nice but it was chips and not nachos, so we were put off by that as well. Vibe is great and
                service good.</p>
